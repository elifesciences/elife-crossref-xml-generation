preferentially to the Golgi suggesting an exceptional avidity of this organelle for curved membranes without stereospecific interactions. We show that the <italic>cis</italic> golgin GMAP-210 accounts for this property. First, the liposome tethering properties of the Golgi resembles that of the amphipathic lipid-packing sensor (ALPS) motif of GMAP-210: both preferred small (radius &lt; 40 nm) liposomes made of monounsaturated but not saturated lipids. Second, reducing GMAP-210 levels or redirecting its ALPS motif to mitochondria decreased liposome capture by the Golgi. Extensive mutagenesis analysis suggests that GMAP-210 tethers authentic transport vesicles <italic>via</italic> the same mechanism whereby the ALPS motif senses lipid-packing defects at the vesicle surface through its regularly spaced hydrophobic residues. We conclude that the Golgi uses GMAP-210 as a filter to select transport vesicles according to their size and bulk lipid composition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16988.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16988.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ALPS motif</kwd><kwd>membrane curvature</kwd><kwd>golgin</kwd><kwd>Golgi</kwd><kwd>transport vesicle</kwd><kwd>perforated cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0028-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antonny</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant 268 888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antonny</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Conseil Départemental des Alpes Maritimes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>appel à projet santé CG06 2013-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antonny</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The golgin GMAP-210 captures vesicles at the cis Golgi by merely recognizing the high curvature and lipid unsaturation level of transport vesicles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>I<bold>ntroduction</bold></title><p>Exchange of material between organelles is largely mediated by transport vesicles, which bud from the surface of a donor compartment through the mechanical action of protein coats and fuse with an acceptor compartment through the action of SNARE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonifacino and Glick, 2004</xref>). Between these two elementary steps, various protein machineries control the fate of transport vesicles. These include molecular motors for long-range transport and tethering complexes, which trap vesicles in the vicinity of their destination organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Golgins are long coiled-coil proteins at the surface of the Golgi apparatus. Through their string-like structure whose length might approach 300 nm, they have been proposed to form a matrix to tether transport vesicles in the vicinity of Golgi cisternae, while excluding some large particles such as ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malsam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Pfeffer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Munro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witkos and Lowe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gillingham and Munro, 2016</xref>). In addition, recent work based on the artificial attachment of golgins to mitochondria indicates that golgins provide a first layer of vesicle selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>). Golgins that are normally anchored on the <italic>cis</italic> side of the Golgi preferentially capture vesicles trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the <italic>cis</italic> Golgi, whereas those that are normally anchored at the <italic>trans</italic> side preferentially capture vesicles from endosomal sources. Although the molecular determinants responsible for this selectivity are not well known, discrete binding sites for Rab proteins have been identified along the coiled-coils of golgins, suggesting a mechanism by which vesicles move within the golgin matrix by transient Rab-coiled-coil contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sinka et al., 2008</xref>). EM and atomic force microscopy show that the coiled-coil architecture of golgins is interrupted by regions of high flexibility, which might facilitate the movement of trapped vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishida et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Stereospecific interactions between proteins and lipids have an undisputed role in membrane traffic. However, other factors related to bulk physicochemical properties of membranes such as membrane curvature, electrostatics and lipid packing also play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>). In the case of vesicle tethering at the Golgi, Kobayashi and Pagano reported in 1988 a puzzling observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobayashi and Pagano, 1988</xref>). When liposomes made of pure lipids were incubated with perforated cells, they bound almost exclusively to the Golgi and not to any other organelle. Binding was fast, occurred at 4°C, did not require ATP, and was observed with simple lipid compositions such as pure egg phosphatidylcholine (PC). In the presence of ATP and at temperature above 15°C, liposome binding was followed by membrane fusion and delivery of the liposome content to the Golgi. Interestingly, the authors noticed that liposomes with a small radius (R &lt; 40 nm) were targeted more efficiently to the Golgi than larger ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobayashi and Pagano, 1988</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the Golgi has a superior ability to capture small vesicles than any other organelle because of an unexplained avidity for curved lipid membranes.</p><p>We previously presented a minimal model for vesicle tethering by the golgin GMAP-210, in which non stereospecific protein-membrane interactions play a predominant role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drin et al., 2008</xref>). GMAP-210, which controls vesicle traffic at the <italic>cis</italic> side of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roboti et al., 2015</xref>), contains an N-terminal ALPS motif [1–38], several long coiled-coil regions, a GRAB domain [1774–1843], and a region of low complexity [1844–1979]. ALPS motifs are amphipathic helices that adsorb preferentially onto highly curved membranes containing unsaturated lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drin and Antonny, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny, 2011</xref>). The GRAB domain interacts with membrane-bound Arf1-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillingham et al., 2004</xref>). Because the Arf1 regulator ArfGAP1, which hydrolyzes GTP on Arf1, also contains an ALPS motif, the interaction between the GRAB domain and Arf1-GTP is not stable on curved membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drin et al., 2008</xref>). Consequently, GMAP-210 tethers small liposomes through its ALPS motif to flatter membranes through its GRAB domain, but other geometrical combinations are not possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drin et al., 2008</xref>). In a cellular context, this model suggests that GMAP-210 connects transport vesicles to Golgi cisternae on the basis of their contrasting membrane curvature.</p><p>Despite some predictions of this model have been successfully tested in cells, notably the relative contribution of the ALPS motif and of the GRAB domain to vesicle <italic>versus</italic> cisternae binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardenas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato et al., 2015</xref>), several major questions remain. First, does GMAP-210 account for the striking avidity of the Golgi for small liposomes? In other words, is GMAP-210 a major vesicle trap? Second, are the amphipathic properties of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 sufficient to explain the selective tethering of the vesicles of the early secretory pathway at the cis-Golgi as opposed to other transport vesicles?</p><p>In this study, we first connect the avidity of the Golgi for small liposomes with the biochemical properties of the golgin GMAP-210. Second, we interrogate the binding mode of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 in a cellular context by extensive mutagenesis. We observe that the ALPS motif is very permissive to mutations that should disrupt stereospecific interactions, but is supersensitive to mutations that modify its amphipathic character. Notably, the sparse distribution of hydrophobic residues along the ALPS sequence is key for vesicle recognition. We conclude that the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 acts as a filter at the entrance of the <italic>cis</italic> Golgi to select transport vesicles of the early secretory pathway based on their small size and high content in unsaturated lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>R<bold>esults</bold></title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Avidity of the Golgi for small liposomes containing monounsaturated lipids</title><p>The Kobayashi-Pagano experiment consists of peeling the upper membrane of cultured cells with a filter followed by incubating the resulting open cells with synthetic fluorescent liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobayashi and Pagano, 1988</xref>).

The liposomes contained trace amounts of a red fluorescent lipid (Rhod-PE), whereas the cells stably expressed Rab6-GFP in order to visualize the Golgi area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). All experiments were performed with no ATP in the medium to minimize liposome fusion. We observed that liposome binding increased strongly with the unsaturation level of PC. Binding was maximal with PC containing two unsaturated acyl chains (C18:1-C18:1-PC = DOPC), barely detectable with PC containing two saturated acyl chains (C14:0-C14:0-PC = DMPC), and intermediate with PC containing one saturated and one monounsaturated acyl chain (C16:0-C18:1-PC = POPC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, liposome size had a strong effect on Golgi binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Below 50 nm in radius, liposomes bound significantly to the Golgi; above this radius, liposome binding was close to background levels. By calibrating the fluorescence intensity as a function of liposome concentration, we estimated that hundreds of small DOPC liposomes were trapped in the Golgi region of each perforated cell (see Materials and methods).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GMAP-210 contributes to the liposome avidity of the Golgi</title><p>The cumulative effects of membrane curvature and lipid unsaturation on the binding of liposomes to the Golgi was reminiscent of the biochemical properties of ALPS motifs, which are present in various proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vanni et al., 2014</xref>). In the case of GMAP-210, the ALPS motif is present at the N-terminus of the golgin, which makes it ideally positioned to capture small transport vesicles or, in the case of perforated cells, small liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>The membrane binding properties of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 have not been characterized as thoroughly as those of the ALPS motifs of ArfGAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mesmin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vanni et al., 2014</xref>). We used a NBD-labeled form of the N-terminal region [1–375] of GMAP-210 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pranke et al., 2011</xref>) and conducted binding experiments with liposomes similar to those used on perforated cells except that they lacked fluorescent lipids. The increase in NBD fluorescence resulting from the adsorption of the ALPS motif onto the liposome surface was used as an index of membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pranke et al., 2011</xref>). The N-terminal region of GMAP-210 showed a sharp preference for liposomes combining high curvature and high content of monounsaturated lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Given the good match between the liposome-binding properties of the Golgi and that of GMAP-210 in vitro, we surmised that GMAP-210 could contribute to the liposome trapping properties of the Golgi. To test this hypothesis, we reduced GMAP-210 expression using two recently described siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roboti et al., 2015</xref>). With both siRNA, the amount of GMAP-210 decreased ≈ seven-fold whereas the liposome tethering capacity of the Golgi decreased 2.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we characterized the perforated cells by immunofluorescence. We observed good colocalization between the trapped liposomes and anti GMAP-210 or anti GM130 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). After treatment with siRNA against GMAP-210, the cells that showed background levels of GMAP-210 showed barely any significant liposome staining at the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The cells expressed two constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The first contained the following regions: the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 [1–38] to capture small liposomes, an artificial coiled-coil (ACC1) to impose a dimeric architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horchani et al., 2014</xref>), a green fluorescent protein (GFP) for visualization, and a FK binding protein (FKBP) for control by rapamycin. The second construct, Mito-FRB, enabled the mitochondria attachment of the first construct by rapamycin-induced dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, we treated the cells with nocodazole, which, by disrupting the microtubules, causes the Golgi to disperse into mini stacks in the cytoplasm. This condition was chosen to increase the probability of liposome exchange between the mitochondria and the Golgi as observed in the case of authentic transport vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato et al., 2015</xref>). After treatment with nocodazole and with or without rapamycin, the cells were perforated and DOPC liposomes labeled with Rhod-PE were added. Without rapamycin, the ALPS-containing construct and the small liposomes colocalized at Golgi mini stacks as identified by GM130 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). With rapamycin, colocalization between the ALPS-containing construct and the liposomes remained, but the liposomes and the ALPS construct overlapped better with mitochondria than with the Golgi mini stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In contrast, ACC1-GFP, which lacks the ALPS motif, was entirely soluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 is not only necessary (as revealed by its deletion), but also sufficient (as revealed by coiled-coil permutation) for cellular localization.

This result can be interpreted in light of previous EM observations. GMAP-210 depletion causes small vesicles to accumulate at the Golgi at the expense of the normal cisternae organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato et al., 2015</xref>), an effect that probably results from a reduction in speed of Golgi assembly through homotypic vesicle fusion.

By connecting these pioneering observations with the molecular and cellular properties of the golgin GMAP-210 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roboti et al., 2015</xref>), our study suggests that the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 acts a filter at the <italic>cis</italic> entrance of the Golgi to select transport vesicles according to their size and bulk lipid composition.</p><p>The ALPS motif of GMAP-210 should be one of the first binding sites that a vesicle entering the golgin matrix should encounter and its sharp preference for small liposomes (R &lt; 40 nm) suggested a mechanism for vesicle capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2008</xref>). The present study with perforated cells further underlines the relevance of this mechanism in a cellular context and also gives insights about its efficiency. We estimate that the Golgi can capture hundreds of small DOPC liposomes (R ≈ 30 nm). This range compares reasonably well with the vesicle density at the Golgi as determined by electron tomography: Ladinsky et al. reported <italic>ca.</italic> 400 vesicles in a tomogram corresponding to 5% of the Golgi area, whereas Marsh et al. reported &gt;2000 vesicles in a larger region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ladinsky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marsh et al., 2001</xref>). Other clues for the efficiency of this mechanism are the massive accumulation of small (R ≈ 30 nm) vesicles in the form of tight clusters when GMAP-210 is overexpressed in yeast or in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pernet-Gallay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pranke et al., 2011</xref>) as well as the displacement of the liposome capture properties when cells express GMAP-210 at the surface of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, GMAP-210 might not be the only golgin accounting for the ability of the Golgi to capture liposomes. Among the various golgins present in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gillingham and Munro, 2016</xref>), we identified another ALPS motif in giantin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drin et al., 2007</xref>). This motif is located within the coiled coil region and therefore might not be involved in the initial capture of vesicles but rather in their movement within the golgin matrix. In the future, combining genetic tools to modify the repertoire of vesicle tethers and liposome-binding experiments on perforated cells should facilitate the analysis of the various modes of vesicle capture by the Golgi and other organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho and Stroupe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuhlee et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria de-routing experiments indicate that GMAP-210 is selective for vesicles of the early secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, functional and structural dissection of GMAP-210 indicates that its ALPS motif has an essential role in vesicle capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato et al., 2015</xref>). Our study suggests that the vesicle selectivity of GMAP-210 does not arise from stereospecific interactions between the ALPS motif and particular protein or lipid determinants, but from the unusual amphipathic properties of this motif. One striking observation is that the targeting of GMAP-210 ALPS to the Golgi is resistant to sequence inversion but is very sensitive to mutations that modify its amphipathic character (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Notably, mutations that disrupt the helix amphipathy cause ALPS dissociation, whereas mutations that reinforce the hydrophobic face promote recognition of other organelles besides the Golgi. Thus, the physicochemical properties of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 seem exquisitely tuned for selective adsorption on the surface of small vesicles of the early secretory pathway. Besides the chemistry of ALPS per se, the dimeric architecture of GMAP-210 also contributes to membrane curvature recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doucet et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>ALPS motifs differ from most membrane-adsorbing helices by the lack of charged residues and the abundance of small neutral residues in the polar face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drin and Antonny, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pranke et al., 2011</xref>). The present study identifies the distribution of hydrophobic residues as a second parameter accounting for the hypersensitivity of ALPS motifs to membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In ALPS, most helical turns contain a single hydrophobic (H) residue (HxxxHxxH…) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">González-Rubio et al., 2011</xref>). In Arf1 and Arf1-like proteins, the N-terminal amphipathic helix contains two hydrophobic residues per turn (HHxxHHx…). Condensing the ALPS sequence in order to pair all single hydrophobic residues makes the helix no longer sensitive to membrane curvature and eliminates its restrictive Golgi distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We suggest that the presence of a single hydrophobic residue per turn prevents each helical turn from being too tightly bound. Since this feature is repeated many times, this amplifies the helix sensitivity to the lipid packing properties of the membrane interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny, 2011</xref>). In conclusion, the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 is optimized to select small vesicles, whereas Arf1 and Arf-like proteins are more permissive to membrane curvature, which enables them to initiate, by a GTP switch, the recruitment of various effectors (coats, tethers, lipid-modifying enzymes, lipid transporters) on membranes of diverse shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherfils, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The membrane of the ER and the <italic>cis</italic> Golgi differ from that of other organelles in their bulk features, including low sterol, low electrostatics and high level of unsaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this latter trait, together with the high curvature of transport vesicles (R = 30–40 nm, for both COPI and COPII vesicles; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malhotra et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlowe, 1994</xref>]) leads to a high level of lipid packing defects, which enable the adsorption of ALPS motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanni et al., 2013</xref>]). The observation that excess phospholipid saturation prevents the correct partitioning of ArfGAP1 at the Golgi supports this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vanni et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, COPI vesicles, which bud from the <italic>cis</italic> Golgi, are rich in unsaturated PC and poor in cholesterol and saturated lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brügger et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, we propose that GMAP-210 recognizes vesicles that shuttle cargoes between the ER and the <italic>cis</italic> Golgi because their membrane combines the highest level of unsaturation with the highest level of curvature. In contrast, small vesicles on the <italic>trans</italic> side of the Golgi are probably ignored by GMAP-210 because their physical features, notably a more ordered bilayer structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klemm et al., 2009</xref>), are not adapted to the ALPS motif.</p><p>In conclusion, GMAP-210 seems to act as a general filter at the <italic>cis</italic> side of the Golgi to select vesicles solely on the basis of their small size and loose lipid packing structure. This mechanism might be sufficient to sort pre Golgi <italic>versus</italic> post Golgi vesicles, thereby maintaining the polarity of this organelle, because changes in lipid composition along the secretory pathway (e.g. sterol accumulation and sphingolipid synthesis) occur mostly at the <italic>trans</italic> side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>). In contrast, GMAP-210 is probably not able to distinguish subclasses of vesicles at the ER/cis Golgi interface. GMAP-210 controls both anterograde and retrograde flows between the ER and the cis Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pernet-Gallay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roboti et al., 2015</xref>) and, when artificially anchored on the mitochondria, captures ER-derived vesicles as well as those that contain Golgi resident enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>). This lack of discrimination might be advantageous for building a new <italic>cis</italic> Golgi cisternae by merging these different vesicles. The only transport intermediates at the ER/Golgi interface that should not be captured by GMAP-210 are large carriers, which transport proteins too big to be packaged into classical vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2015</xref>). In this respect, it is interesting to note that deletion of GMAP-210 in mouse leads to defects in the secretion of a relatively small matrix protein, perlecan, but not of large collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smits et al., 2010</xref>). GMAP-210 is also reported to function in the cilium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Follit et al., 2008</xref>). A plausible hypothesis is that GMAP-210 diverts vesicles with a special level of lipid unsaturation from the Golgi. As such, GMAP-210 could help building an organelle that, despite being continuous with the plasma membrane, displays a very different lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verhey and Yang, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs</title><p>ACC1 and ACC2 are artificial coiled-coils.

After 5 min of incubation at 30°C, cells were washed several times with DMEM/F12 medium without red phenol (Gibco) and cells were observed in a wide-field microscope (Olympus IX83). The Golgi area was determined by the Rab6-GFP signal, and a corresponding mask was then applied to the red channel to determine the liposome fluorescence in the same area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA interference</title><p>Cells were transfected with 15 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, CA, USA) for a 35 mm glass coverslip.

Lipids in chloroform were mixed in a pear-shape vial and dried in a rotary evaporator. The lipid film was hydrated at 2 to 10 mM lipids either in HK buffer (Hepes 50 mM, KAcetate 120 mM, pH 7,4) for biochemical experiments or in Hepes 25 mM, KCl 115 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5 mM, pH 7,2 for the experiments with perforated cells. After five cycles of freezing and thawing, the liposomes were extruded sequentially through polycarbonate filters with pore diameters of 200, 100, 50 and 30 nm. Alternatively, small liposomes were obtained by sonication with a titanium tip sonicator (2 × 10 min in ice) and centrifuged for 20 min at 45,000 rpm to remove titanium debris. The liposome hydrodynamic radius (Rh) was measured by dynamic light scattering in a Dyna Pro instrument.

The bilayer contained 60 mol% PC, 30 mol% PE and 10 mol% cholesterol. The acyl chain profile of PC and PE was 6 mol% C16:0-C16:0, 59 mol% 16:0-C18:1 and 35 mol% C18:1-C18:1. Note that the MARTINI coarse-grained model does not distinguish close lipid species such as C18:0-C18:1 and C16:0-C18:1. Therefore, these two lipid species, which are present in COPI vesicles, were simulated using the same coarse-grained model. The flat, tubular and spherical models of <italic>cis</italic> Golgi-like membranes were built from the corresponding DOPC structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vanni et al., 2014</xref>). In successive steps, the correct percentage of DOPC molecules was changed <italic>via</italic> molecular replacement into the new lipids (DPPE, POPE, DOPE, DPPC, POPC and cholesterol). After each molecular replacement, the system was minimized using a steepest descent algorithm. Next, the systems were subjected to MD runs of 900 ns (flat, tubule) and 150 ns (vesicle) in the NPT ensemble. Analyses were carried out on the last 600 ns (flat), 450 ns (tubule) and 100 ns (vesicle). All simulations details as well as analysis for lipid-packing defects are identical to those described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vanni et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Suzanne Pfeffer, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper follows up on a striking observation from the Pagano lab, that liposomes, especially those of smaller radius, show preferential affinity for the Golgi when added to semi-intact cells. Here, the authors confirm this finding and show that a significant portion of Golgi affinity is due to the ALPS motif of the tethering protein, GMAP210. This study takes a phenomenological observation and converts it into an impactful, cell biological finding with an interesting molecular basis. The authors go on to show that an inverted amphipathic helix is sufficient and a condensed ALPS motif is less compartment-specific. In general the study is carried out to a high standard and the results will be of broad interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers support presentation in <italic>eLife</italic> after the following issues have been adequately addressed.</p><p>1) The title of the work is: &quot;A filter at the entrance of the Golgi that selects vesicles according to size and bulk lipid composition.&quot; The overall significance of the story would be greatly enhanced if the authors were to demonstrate the physiological significance of their findings in ALPS motif rescue experiments. This is of particular importance given reports suggesting that loss of GMAP210 can cause changes in cilia. The authors should use CRISPR to remove GMAP210 and then rescue with a version of GMAP210 that lacks the ALPS motif. This would allow them to determine if ER to Golgi traffic and intra-Golgi traffic are really dependent on the ALPS motif, and also to confirm the conclusion that the ALPS motif in GMAP-210 is the primary component responsible for liposome capture in permeabilized cells.</p><p>2) An unexpected observation is that the ALPS motif alone is targeted to the early Golgi, as if vesicles are accumulating there for interaction. Is this true in GMAP-210 depleted cells? Is this also true for the ALPs motif from ArfGAP1? Please elaborate. Please provide evidence that this really is the Golgi vs. a peri-Golgi compartment.</p><p>3) The mitochondrial tethering experiment data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> could be better of quality.

(2015). The golgin GMAP-210 is required for efficient membrane trafficking in the early secretory pathway.

A., &amp; Lowe, M. (2015). Coupling of vesicle tethering and Rab binding is required for in vivo functionality of the golgin GMAP-210.

Rescue experiments are presented in the second paper, which were conducted with various forms of GMAP-210, including ∆ALSP-GMAP-210.</p><p>These studies show that the ALPS motif is necessary for the vesicle tethering activity of GMAP-210 (a complete description of these deletion/rescue experiments is shown in Figure 10 of Sato et al). However, Lowe noticed: “We show here that GMAP-210–mediated tethering in cells is mediated exclusively by the N-terminal ALPS motif. On the face of it, this may appear surprising. Tethering is a specific process, with different golgins able to tether different types of vesicles (Wong and Munro, 2014), yet the ALPS motif binds to membrane lipids”. Our study addresses this issue by showing the importance of curvature and lipid unsaturation for selective vesicle capture.</p><p>Of note, the efficiency of GMAP-210 silencing with siRNA is very high (typically, &gt; 95% in the case of Lowe; 85% in our case). Therefore, a CRISPR strategy is not mandatory at this point although this approach will be interesting to better address the physiological function of GMAP-210 in the future (as mentioned in the new final paragraph of the Discussion).</p><p>As for the physiological function of GMAP-210, two KO mouse have been presented:</p><p>Follit, J. A., Agustin, J. T. S., Xu, F., Jonassen, J. A., Samtani, R., Lo, C. W., &amp; Pazour, G. J. (2008). The Golgin GMAP210/TRIP11 Anchors IFT20 to the Golgi Complex.

Follit observed defects in cilium morphology and function through a decrease in Hedgehog signaling. Smits observed defects in skeletal tissue through decrease in perlican secretion. Although our aim was not to resolve these conflicting studies, our study suggests some hypotheses. First, the defect in perlecan secretion and glycosyslation contrasts with the normal fate of type II collagen and aggregan, which are much bigger matrix proteins. Given the ability of GMAP-210 to select vesicles based on their size, GMAP-210 deficiency should affect only matrix proteins that are incorporated into small classical transport vesicles. Second, the primary cilium has a different lipid composition than the plasma membrane in which it is embedded. Thanks to its ability to select transport vesicles according to their bulk lipid composition, GMAP-210 could help making this atypical membrane structure. These two hypotheses are presented in the new final paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) An unexpected observation is that the ALPS motif alone is targeted to the early Golgi, as if vesicles are accumulating there for interaction. Is this true in GMAP-210 depleted cells? Is this also true for the ALPs motif from ArfGAP1? Please elaborate. Please provide evidence that this really is the Golgi vs. a peri-Golgi compartment.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To address these points, we have conducted new experiments in which the cells were first siRNA treated for 72 hrs to deplete GMAP-210 and then transiently transfected with probes expressing the ALPS motif. Alternatively, we used cells stably expressing ArfGAP1 (see Vanni et al. 2014 Nat Comm) and again treated the cell with GMAP-210 si RNA. These experiments are presented in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In both cases, the reporter (ArfGAP1 or the ALPS containing probe) remains localized at the Golgi in contrast with liposomes, which no longer accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, Lowe et al. noticed that depletion of GMAP-210 by siRNA causes vesicles to accumulate at the Golgi at the expense of Golgi cisternae. Probably the vesicles are taken in charge by the other golgins but the flow of vesicle capture and fusion is modified by GMAP-210 deletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in Roboti et al). Therefore, there should be enough authentic vesicles for ALPS binding, which is what we observe. These new experiments are presented in a new paragraph of the Results section (subsection “Selective <italic>cis</italic> Golgi targeting of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210”, fourth paragraph).</p><p>Since this observation does not allow us to connect the two central observations of our paper (the role of GMAP-210 in liposome capture and the targeting of the ALPS motif to the early Golgi), we performed a different experiment, which is shown in a new Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We perforated cells that over express the ALPS probe (ALPS-ACC1-GFP). We observed more liposome capture in these cells than in control cells. This observation complements the siRNA experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and indicates a correlation between liposome tethering activity of the Golgi and the amount of ALPS motif present. We present these new experiments in the Results section (subsection “Selective <italic>cis</italic> Golgi targeting of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210”, last paragraph.</p><p><italic>3) The mitochondrial tethering experiment data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> could be better of quality. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> it is not clear what are Golgi fragments versus mitochondria. The same applies for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Additional counterstains for mitochondria and Golgi would clarify the results. Also, some controls seem missing. There should be [no rapamycin+nocodazole], which is the better control for the [rapamycin+nocodazole] samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> also need counter staining for the Golgi. It is not possible to easily discern the Golgi from other membrane compartments without the Golgi counter labelling.</italic></p><p>We acknowledge that the previous main figure lacked proper controls and that the use of only two colors (red for liposomes, green for the ALPS construct) made the analysis ambiguous without further staining of membrane compartments. In addition, the supplementary figure was a jumble of different controls.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we now focus on two conditions in the main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>): + nocodazole – rapamycin and + nocodazole + rapamycin. In the text, we better explain the advantage of using nocodazole to favor competition between Golgi mini stacks and mitochondria for vesicles capture (following the observation of Wong and Munro and of Sato et al.). In addition, three colors are now used: red: liposomes; green: the ALPS constructs; and violet: GM130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or MitoTracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A second figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) shows the effect of liposome size on liposome capture through mitochondria-targeted ALPS. All figures also contain a small scheme to better explain the experimental conditions.</p><p>As for the quality of the images, we hope that the new ones are more satisfactory. However, and as explained in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, cell perforation clearly damages the mitochondria network, leaving remnants that are less connected and show a round shape.</p><p>As for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> a new supplement figure now shows the counter staining for the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Results: &quot;GMAP-210 is responsible (for a large portion) of the ability of the Golgi&quot; (please modify). Are there other obvious candidate proteins that can explain the residual fluorescence detected over the Golgi in GMAP-210 depleted cells? Please discuss.</italic></p><p>We have modified the sentence to temper our conclusion: “Altogether, the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> indicate that GMAP-210 makes a major contribution to the liposome capture property of the Golgi” and added more information on this point in the Discussion (second paragraph).</p><p>Thus, we performed a new bioinformatics search for ALPS-like motifs considering all golgins described by Munro in a recent review. The following list shows the corresponding Uniprot entry numbers:</p><p>O60763, P82094, Q7Z5G4, Q8IWJ2, Q8TBA6, Q96CN9, Q08378, Q08379, Q13439, Q13948, Q14789, Q15643, Q92805</p><p>As before (Drin et al. 2007), we found an ALPS motif in the golgin giantin (entry: Q14789|GOGB1_HUMAN Golgin subfamily). The corresponding sequence is: (2726)NKGLTAQIQSFGRSMSSLQNS(2746). This motif is localized within the coiled-coil region of this giant protein, about 500 a.a., apart from the transmembrane domain. As such, it might act as a binding site for small vesicles deeper in the golgin matrix as compared to the ALPS motif of GMAP-210, which resides at the N-terminus. However, the ALPS motif of giantin shows a moderate but significant probability to be folded as a coiled-coil. The potential role of this motif is now discussed (Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. Why is nocodazole used? What happens if it is omitted? Also, given that the ALPS motif will capture endogenous small vesicles how can they be sure that the liposomes are not binding to these vesicles rather than directly to the ALPS motif?</italic></p><p>See response to point 3.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>/C. It seems hard to reconcile the small effects seen by immunofluorescence with the large effects shown in the quantitation. This is in contrast with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> – please explain.</italic> </p><p>The reader eye focuses on the organelle displaying the highest fluorescence level. For quantification, however, we did only not consider the absolute fluorescence at the Golgi but instead the Golgi/cytosol ratio. For this, we divided the fluorescence in a ‘Golgi box’ by the fluorescence in a ‘cytosol box’ of the same surface. This method gives a fair estimate of the Golgi/cytosol partitioning of the various constructs and allows detecting modest changes between constructs that do decorate the Golgi but show different levels in the cytosol. However, we acknowledge that the image contrast was not optimal to appreciate some differences in the protein level in the cytosol. We have added a supplementary figure in gray levels to better illustrate this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
