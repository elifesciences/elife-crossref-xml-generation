Algorithms designed to automate image segmentation suffer from substantial error rates and require significant manual error correction. Any improvement in segmentation error rates would therefore directly reduce the time required to analyze 3D EM data. We explored preserving extracellular space (ECS) during chemical tissue fixation to improve the ability to segment neurites and to identify synaptic contacts. ECS preserved tissue is easier to segment using machine learning algorithms, leading to significantly reduced error rates. In addition, we observed that electrical synapses are readily identified in ECS preserved tissue. Finally, we determined that antibodies penetrate deep into ECS preserved tissue with only minimal permeabilization, thereby enabling correlated light microscopy (LM) and EM studies. We conclude that preservation of ECS benefits multiple aspects of the connectomic analysis of neural circuits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08206.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08206.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08206.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain consists of billions of neurons that are connected into many different circuits. Mapping the connections between these neurons could help researchers to understand how the nervous system works. A method commonly used to do so is to preserve samples of brain tissue in chemical fixatives, and then image thin slices of this tissue using powerful microscopes.</p><p>As each tissue sample contains many neurons, computer algorithms have been developed to analyze the microscope images and automatically identify the neurons and the connections they make. However, these algorithms often make 'segmentation errors' that researchers need to manually correct: for example, overlapping neurons may be counted as a single neuron, or a neuron may be marked into several segments. Correcting these errors is a time-consuming and tedious task that limits how much of the brain can be currently mapped. Future algorithm improvements will hopefully reduce the number of errors; Pallotto, Watkins et al. explored an alternative approach by making the images themselves easier to analyze using existing algorithms.</p><p>The chemicals used to preserve brain tissue often suck out the fluids that fill the spaces between the neurons, causing these 'extracellular spaces' to shrink. Pallotto, Watkins et al. have now developed a method of preserving tissue that maintains more space between the neurons, and used this method to preserve samples of mouse brain with different amounts of extracellular space. Pallotto, Watkins et al. found that the algorithm used to analyze the images of these samples made far fewer segmentation errors on samples that contained more extracellular space. It was also easier to identify the connections between different neurons in these samples. The next challenge will be to extend these methods to preserving extracellular space across whole brains.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08206.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08206.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>connectomics</kwd><kwd>extracellular space</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>gap junction</kwd><kwd>tissue fixation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program (NS003133)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pallotto</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Paul V</given-names></name><name><surname>Fubara</surname><given-names>Boma</given-names></name><name><surname>Briggman</surname><given-names>Kevin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY017836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singer</surname><given-names>Joshua H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Briggman</surname><given-names>Kevin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Briggman</surname><given-names>Kevin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Automated segmentation of neurons and identification of synapses in electron micrographs is significantly improved by using simple modifications to chemical fixation protocols that preserve extracellular space in the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A number of recent technological advances have automated the collection of serial section electron microscopy (EM) data from the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggman and Bock 2012</xref>). Complete (connectomic) mapping of synaptic connectivity in these datasets, however, is hampered by the lack of automated analysis methods. The two most important goals for neuronal circuit reconstruction are the reliable reconstruction of neuronal morphologies and the identification of synapses. The delineation of morphologies has proven to be the most difficult step to automate. Current machine learning-based analysis methods enable semi-automated reconstructions (segmentations) of neurons that still require significant human effort to correct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Many of the errors encountered during the automated segmentation of neuronal morphologies are related to the dense packing of neurites in neuropil, which frequently leads to the artifactual merging of neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2010</xref>). Merging errors are particularly difficult to detect and correct, so most current approaches attempt to reduce merging errors by biasing the output of algorithms to generate over-segmentations of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Over-segmentation splits neurons into many small objects that must then be reassembled into complete morphologies, a labor-intensive process. Here, we illustrate that automated segmentation error rates are improved by reducing the packing density of neurites in neuropil.</p><p>The preparation of tissue for EM requires finding a compromise among several potential artifacts. One of the most significant, but often underappreciated, artifacts encountered during aldehyde-based fixation is the loss of extracellular space (ECS). Although this artifact was described decades ago, it has been omitted from major texts describing the ultrastructure of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peters et al., 1991</xref>). The artifact was first recognized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Van Harreveld and Malhotra (1967</xref>) and was convincingly demonstrated by comparing the appearance of aldehyde-fixed tissue with that of frozen tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Harreveld and Steiner 1970a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">1970b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Harreveld and Fifkova 1975</xref>). The ultrastructure of rapidly frozen tissue revealed appreciable ECS volume fractions of 15–25%, depending on the brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Harreveld and Khattab 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Harreveld and Fifkova 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>), compared to less than 5% ECS in aldehyde-fixed tissue. The presence of large in vivoECS volume fractions was corroborated by complementary methods including brain conductivity measurements, tracer diffusion studies, and more modern high-pressure freezing experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rostaing et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sykova and Nicholson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>). The primary cause of ECS loss is a net inward flux of ions during tissue fixation, which increases intracellular osmolarity, leading to a redistribution of water into cells and resulting in a swelling of cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Van Harreveld and Malhotra 1967</xref>). Cragg subsequently developed a method to preserve ECS during chemical fixation using a simple ion substitution protocol that replaces extracellular sodium and chloride with a membrane-impermeant molecule such as sucrose prior to fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cragg 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">1980</xref>), preventing the net inward ion flux that leads to swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08206.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ECS preservation in acutely isolated tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A model of the changes brain tissue undergoes during chemical tissue fixation and possible interventions to preserve ECS.

We tested this hypothesis in the study presented here. Our goal was not to approximate the actual in vivo distribution of ECS. Rather, we reasoned that any manipulation of the ultrastructure that improved image segmentation, including perhaps exaggerating ECS volume fractions beyond physiological ranges, would be beneficial for connectomics so long as the manipulation did not alter synaptic connectivity. By utilizing an ECS-preserving chemical fixation protocol, we were able to titrate the ECS volume fraction in a variety of brain regions. We measured a significant reduction in automated segmentation error rates as the ECS fraction increased, indicating that ECS preservation improves the ability to automatically reconstruct neuronal morphologies from EM data.</p><p>We then explored the second important goal of connectomics, the reliable identification of synapses. Electrical synapses are particularly difficult to identify in conventionally prepared (swollen) tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rash et al., 1998</xref>). We focused on identifying electrical synapses in a known retinal circuit and found that gap junctions were readily identifiable in ECS-preserved tissue, again due to the increased separation between neurites. Finally, we demonstrate that ECS preservation leads to significant improvements in the diffusion of antibodies into tissue sections with minimal disruption of ultrastructure, an important prerequisite for correlating immunofluorescence with EM. Therefore, we conclude that there are multiple practical benefits to preserving ECS that improve the connectomic analysis of neuronal circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Preservation of extracellular space</title><p>Cragg described an ECS preservation protocol for chemical immersion fixation that involved briefly bathing acute slices in an unbuffered sucrose solution and then fixing sections in a sucrose/phosphate buffer with glutaraldehyde. We initially applied Cragg’s protocol to acute brain sections of the mouse cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb and, while ECS was preserved, membranes appeared excessively wrinkled. We therefore developed an alternative strategy to preserve ECS by simply varying the osmolarity of the fixative buffer. Because the loss of ECS during chemical fixation ultimately is due to an imbalance in osmolarity across cellular membranes, we reasoned that adjusting the osmolarity of the fixation buffer would enable us to control the ECS fraction in fixed tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is known that buffer molecules rather than fixative molecules contribute most to the physiological osmotic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Young 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bone and Ryan 1972</xref>). Overall, we noticed smoother membranes using the osmolarity-based approach compared to the sucrose/phosphate protocol.</p><p>We observed that the preserved ECS fraction was positively correlated with the osmolarity of the fixation buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C–F</xref>). For example, a volume fraction of 23.9% in the external plexiform layer (EPL) of the olfactory bulb was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) when fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde buffered with 175 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (CB, 343 mOsm) compared to 5.8% ECS when fixed with 100 mM CB (204 mOsm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By comparison, fixing tissue by transcardial perfusion, in which the blood–brain barrier remains intact, consistently yielded &lt;1% ECS in the EPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). We observed that we could achieve unrealistically large ECS fractions of &gt;25% in the olfactory bulb by raising the buffer osmolarity above 400–450 mOsm, but we began to observe significant membrane ruptures and excessive cellular shrinkage under these conditions. To examine whether overall tissue dimensions changed (either swelled or shrinked) as a function of the preserved ECS fraction, we measured the cross-sectional thickness of 500 µm cortical sections by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not observe a correlation between the fixative osmolarity and section thickness (p=0.46, one-way ANOVA), indicating macroscopic tissue dimensions are not affected by osmolarity-based ECS preservation. We also noted that ECS was preserved uniformly across 500-µm-thick sections, the maximum thickness that we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Preservation of ECS was similar whether tissue was sectioned at 4°C or 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating the described protocol is suitable if alterations of neuronal morphology due to cold shock are a concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourne et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We repeated the above experiments for various brain regions including the cerebral cortex and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The only exception was the mouse retina, for which we were unable to preserve ECS by changing the osmolarity of the fixative buffer. Replacing the fixative buffer with unbuffered sucrose, although, restored our ability to preserve ECS in an osmolarity-dependent way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). One possible explanation for this is that cellular membranes in the retina are permeable to the cacodylate anion (138 g/mol), but not to sucrose (342 g/mol). This observation indicates that the protocol requires fine-tuning for different brain regions, but we were able to control ECS preservation in every region we have studied.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reduction in 2D automated segmentation error rates</title><p>Given the ability to predictably control ECS volume fractions, we next investigated whether the increased separation between neighboring neurites in ECS-preserved data would lead to lower error rates in the automated analyses of EM data. Qualitatively, we observed that ECS-preserved data are far easier for human annotators to analyze (e.g. to trace neurons over long distances to create skeleton representations). We therefore asked whether such data also were quantitatively easier to segment by automated machine learning algorithms. We used 2D EM images from the EPL of the mouse olfactory bulb as representative samples containing densely packed neuropil. Samples were prepared by perfusion fixation, yielding an ECS fraction of 0.6%, or by acute slice fixation as described above, yielding ECS fractions of 5.8%, 11.3%, and 23.9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then manually labeled a portion of these images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, second column) and used the labeled data to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs, see 'Materials and methods'). The networks were trained to classify each pixel as belonging either to intracellular space (including cytosol and organelles), to plasma membrane, or to ECS.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08206.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Automated 2D segmentation of extracellular space preserved data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Four raw EM images (first column) of varying ECS fractions (0.6, 5.8, 11.3, and 23.9%) were analyzed.

Similar pixel classification errors were observed regardless of ECS fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that networks were equally able to learn the statistics of the images. We, however, were interested primarily in the degree to which ECS preservation affected the ability of neural networks to segment actual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore joined (segmented) regions of neighboring intracellular pixels and measured segmentation performance using two common segmentation metrics (see 'Materials and methods'). We color-coded segmentations using a four-color map method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, fourth column) such that neighboring objects do not share a color. This approach helps to highlight the locations of two predominant error-types: mergers between neurons that should have been segmented as independent objects as well as the splitting of neurons into multiple objects. We observed a significant reduction in segmentation errors that correlated with increasing ECS fraction, regardless of the error metric we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, despite sharing similar pixel classification errors, images that contained some degree of ECS were easier to automatically segment.

Notably, the total number of skeletons (LowECS=220, HighECS=217), the total skeletonized path length (LowECS = 3.29 mm, HighECS = 3.40 mm) and the median neurite path length (LowECS = 10.2 [7.6 – 13.3] µm, HighECS = 10.1 [6.6 – 12.7] µm, median [IQR]) were similar between the two datasets. The distributions of neurite path lengths were not significantly different between the two datasets (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, p=0.91).

Similar to the 2D results, we observed a significantly lower Rand error for the HighECS dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The threshold level that led to the minimum error rate was also lower for the HighECS dataset, indicating that fewer mergers were encountered compared to the LowECS data. We also measured the number of merged skeleton nodes and split skeleton edges as a function of network threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The two datasets yielded similar minimum edge split error rates, but the LowECS data achieved a lower node merger error rate. Finally, we measured the total error-free skeleton path length that was recovered as a function of network threshold. We recovered 40% and 47% of the total GT path length for the LowECS and HighECS datasets, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We note that the error metrics were calculated based on a watershed of the network output and that no additional steps to improve the segmentations, such as supervoxel agglomeration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nunez-Iglesias et al., 2014</xref>), were applied.

Chemical synapses indicated by clusters of presynaptic vesicles are relatively easy to identify in most brain regions. The identification of electrical synapses (gap junctions), however, remains difficult even in the highest resolution electron micrographs. The number of missed electrical synapses based on thin section images has been estimated to be as high as 75–95% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rash et al., 1998</xref>). Unless gap junctions are captured in cross-section in an electron micrograph, electron tomography is usually required to positively identify a gap junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rash et al., 1998</xref>). But performing electron tomography on every putative gap junction in a large EM volume would prohibitively slow data acquisition of even modestly large volumes. We hypothesized that gap junctions would be easier to identify in ECS-preserved tissue given the reduction in incidental (non-synaptic) contacts between cells.</p><p>We tested this idea in the well-studied AII amacrine cell circuit of the mammalian retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demb and Singer 2012</xref>). The AII amacrine cell receives ribbon-type chemical synapses from rod bipolar cells and conventional chemical synapses from other amacrine cells. Importantly, it is known that AIIs are coupled electrically to each other as well as to the terminals of ON cone bipolar cells by gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hartveit and Veruki 2012</xref>). We therefore sought to identify gap junctions on a portion of an AII amacrine cell reconstructed from 3D SBEM data.</p><p>We volumetrically reconstructed an AII amacrine cell and then annotated all contacts onto a distal portion of its dendritic tree. Contacts were identified as membranes closely apposed (within 50 nm) to the AII’s dendrite (n = 171 total contacts). For the majority of these contacts, we observed a clear cleft between the apposed membranes (n = 150 cleft contacts), but, as well, we noted many instances in which we could not observe any cleft (n = 21 tight contacts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>, see also Supplemental Data stacks). For each contact, we then traced the cell forming the contact through the 3D SBEM volume and classified each cell into four categories: AII amacrine cell, ON cone bipolar cell, presynaptic amacrine cell, or other (see 'Materials and methods'). The ‘other’ category included a variety of cell types including bipolar, amacrine, ganglion and glial cells that, although making cleft contact with the AII, formed no obvious synapse (e.g. no presynaptic clouds of vesicles were observed). Of the 150 cleft contacts, 13 were attributed to chemical synapses from amacrine cells. The remaining 137 cleft contacts assigned to the ‘other’ category were deemed to be incidental contacts or ribbon-type synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08206.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Extracellular space aids the identification of gap junctions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reconstructed dendrites of an AII amacrine cell (gray) and surface renderings of tight (yellow) and cleft (black) contacts.

Of the 21 tight contacts we annotated, 4 were formed with a neighboring AII amacrine cell and 17 were formed with ON cone bipolar cell terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Thus, in every instance, the tight contact was formed with a cell type known to be electrically coupled to the AII amacrine cell indicating that tight contacts in ECS preserved data are consistent with gap junctions. Moreover, AII-AII gap junctions were found in sublamina 5 of the IPL, and AII-ON cone bipolar gap junctions were found in sublaminae 3 and 4, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Strettoia et al., 1992</xref>). We noted that the gap junctions were not identifiable based on contact geometry measurements, such as surface area, alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The preservation of ECS therefore enabled the identification of gap junctions due to the relative scarcity of contacts amongst cells and the simple segregation of contacts into tight versus cleft categories.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Improved diffusion depths of antibodies</title><p>Finally, we explored whether ECS preservation could improve the ability to correlate fluorescent immuno-labeling of proteins with EM ultrastructure. A long-standing problem with preparing brain tissue for immunohistochemical observation is the incomplete diffusion of antibodies into large tissue volumes. Antibodies are large proteins and therefore strong permeabilization of tissue is typically required for labeling thick tissue sections. Often, the degree of permeabilization required to label thick samples destroys the fine tissue ultrastructure. We hypothesized that the preservation of ECS would allow antibodies to penetrate deeper into tissue and would, therefore, require only minimal permeabilization. We tested this idea in the mouse retina using antibodies against the vesicular acetylcholine (VAChT) and GABA (VGAT) transporters, two antibodies that generate distinct labeling patterns in the retina. Following a fixation and minimal permeabilization procotol that we developed in order to preserve ECS and decent tissue ultrastructure (see 'Materials and methods'), we incubated 200-µm-thick retinal sections with primary and secondary antibodies for relatively short durations (9 hr each) and measured the labelling depth. We observed deeper penetration of both antibodies in ECS-preserved retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). VAChT penetrated 28.1 ± 2.4 µm in ECS-preserved samples versus 6.8 ± 0.5 µm in control samples; VGAT penetration was 16.9 ± 1.0 µm versus 6.1 ± 0.4 µm for ECS-preserved and control samples, respectively. The labeling patterns were consistent with the known expression patterns of the two transporters in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koulen 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>). We processed these same pieces of retina for EM and confirmed that the penetration depth correlated with the ECS fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, 0.2% vs. 19.2% ECS fraction). Furthermore, the ultrastructure of the weakly permeabilized tissue was well preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08206.023</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Extracellular space preservation increases access to antibodies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flat-mounted retinas were immunolabeled for vACHT with and without ECS preservation.

Manual data analysis allows targeted reconstructions of small population of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>) but is unfeasible for dense reconstructions. Automating image segmentation is therefore necessary for any reasonable scalability; trained human annotators, however, will still be required to correct the results of automated image processing algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, any reduction in the error rates of automated segmentations of large EM datasets will directly reduce the required human effort to correct, or ‘proofread’, errors.</p><p>Our findings indicate that preserving ECS aids the connectomic analysis of neuronal circuits in multiple ways. The loss of ECS during the conventional chemical fixation of brain tissue leads to densely packed neurites and tightly apposed plasma membranes that complicate automated analyses of EM data. We reasoned that preserving some degree of ECS would improve automated image segmentation methods due to the increased separation of non-synaptic membrane appositions. We emphasize that our goal was not to preserve in vivo-like ECS or neuronal volumes. Indeed, freezing tissue is likely the only way to approximate in vivo-like morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>). Our goal was rather to measure image segmentation performance as a function of increasing ECS volume fractions. In other words, because changes in ECS are unavoidable during the chemical fixation of brain tissue, why not adjust the artifact to be more beneficial to us from a data analysis standpoint? Indeed, it was possible that actually exceeding in vivo ECS volume fractions would lead to the best segmentation performance. On the contrary, we found that while preserving ECS improved segmentation performance, the performance did not continue to improve with increasing ECS fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). One of the reasons for the diminishing returns on segmentation performance is the shrinkage of cells that accompanies increasing ECS fractions which makes segmenting thin processes, particularly glial sheets, more error prone. There, therefore, appears to be an optimal ECS fraction from the standpoint of image segmentation that balances the increased separation between neurites with the shrinkage of cellular compartments. Modest ECS fractions of 6% already significantly improve segmentation performance compared to fractions of &lt;1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), typical of standard perfusion fixation protocols.</p><p>Most current EM segmentation strategies rely on generating over-segmentations (neurons are split into many objects) to avoid accidental mergers between neighboring neurons. These over-segmented objects then are joined together algorithmically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nunez-Iglesias et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2014</xref>) and/or by human annotators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). The segmentation of ECS-preserved data results in fewer mergers, leading to better initial segmentations, and therefore should reduce the human effort required to generate accurate reconstructions. We modified a state-of-the-art CNN originally designed for natural image classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>) to analyze EM data. The CNNs we trained achieved similar pixel classification error rates regardless of the ECS fraction of a sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but segmentation errors were reduced substantially by increasing ECS fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In other words, pixel classification errors have a more detrimental impact on segmentation when cells are tightly packed versus when they are separated by ECS. This basic observation should hold regardless of the particular analysis approach used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rigoll et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jurrus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Turaga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berning et al., 2015</xref>). Our analysis showed that the improved segmentation performance in 2D images also extends to 3D segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In order to prepare tissue with the ECS volume fractions we desired, we modified an existing protocol for ECS preservation in chemically fixed tissues. The modification we made involved simply changing the osmolarity of the buffer used during fixation. This approach, however, was not successful in the mouse retina; we had to rather change to unbuffered sucrose fixation to preserve ECS in the retina. We have successfully preserved ECS uniformly across 500-µm-thick acute brain slices, the thickest slices we tested. High-pressure freezing is an alternative to chemical fixation that also preserves ECS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rostaing et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sykova and Nicholson 2008</xref>). The maximum slice thickness that is adequately preserved using this technique, however, is at most 200 µm: too thin to contain many neuronal circuits. The chemical preservation protocol we used is also far less expensive to implement than high-pressure freezing and is simple to evaluate in different brain regions and species.</p><p>A 500-µm section is a sufficiently large volume to contain many of the local neuronal circuits in the brain, such as a cortical column. Because improvements in data acquisition speeds eventually will allow larger volumes to be acquired, extending uniform ECS preservation to, for example, a whole mouse brain is an important goal. A previous study described a transcardial perfusion-based approach to preserve ECS throughout the brain involving transient opening of the blood-brain barrier and ion replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cragg 1980</xref>), but the uniformity of the ECS fraction across the brain was not evaluated. Given the benefits we observed, further exploration and validation of this whole-brain ECS preservation method is warranted.</p><p>The unambiguous identification of gap junctions is a long-standing problem in the analysis of brain circuits by EM. When ECS is lost, conventional transmission EM with pixel resolutions of a few nm can resolve gap junctions only when they are oriented such that they are captured in cross-section; electron tomography is required to resolve gap junctions oriented obliquely to the image plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rash et al., 1998</xref>). Performing electron tomography on each putative gap junction in a large tissue volume is impractical. We therefore determined whether ECS preservation aided gap junction detection at a moderate pixel resolution (10 nm) using SBEM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">(Denk and Horstmann, 2004</xref> ) data. We found that subsets of all contacts onto an AII amacrine cell in the mouse retina are tight contacts with no visible cleft. We identified all these tight contacts as being formed with cells known to be coupled electrically to AIIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although we performed this analysis manually, we anticipate a relatively straightforward method for automating the detection of tight contacts between cells. Along the same lines, the automated identification of chemical synapses may also be aided simply because there are fewer incidental contacts between cells in ECS-preserved data. Importantly, the analysis of the AII amacrine cell circuitry demonstrates that the known synaptic connectivity is present in ECS-preserved tissue.</p><p>Correlating fluorescence immunohistochemistry with EM data can add significant functional information to purely structural descriptions of circuits. However, there is usually a tradeoff between the degree of permeabilization required for antibody penetration and the quality of ultrastructural preservation. The preservation of ECS retains large diffusion pathways, allowing deeper penetration of large antibody proteins into tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The increased access to antibodies allowed for the use of a minimal permeabilization pre-embedding protocol that preserves satisfactory tissue ultrastructure for subsequent EM examination of antibody-labeled tissue.</p><p>The ECS-preserved EM images of the brain we report here appear substantially different from the vast majority of published EM data over the last 50 years. Practitioners of rapid freezing-based tissue preservation, however, have appreciated the loss of ECS as a major artifact in conventional EM tissue processing for decades. We wish to, in particular, note the pioneering work of Anthonie Van Harreveld who first elucidated this artifact in EM and whose careful analyses directly led to the ECS-preserving interventions that we employed. The relatively minor changes to existing tissue fixation protocols that preserve ECS ultimately benefit several aspects of the connectomic analysis of neuronal circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tissue fixation protocols</title><p>We fixed and examined tissue from a variety of brain regions of C57BL/6 mice, aged 9-12 weeks in accordance with NIH animal ethics guidelines.</p><p>For ECS preservation in acute slices, mice were deeply anesthetized using a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg IP) and xylazine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg IP) or isoflurane (Forane, Baxter, Deerfield, IL) and then swiftly decapitated.

At each binarization step, connected components (four connectivity for 2D, six connectivity for 3D) were created for all pixels above the threshold. Any components that fell below a minimum size threshold parameter (T<sub>min</sub>) of 64 pixels for 2D or 256 voxels for 3D were accumulated in a binary mask. Tests for the sensitivity of this parameter revealed that it had less than 1% impact on all metrics measured across the ranges tested (T<sub>min</sub> = 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256). This step essentially was a method for detecting local peaks in the probabilities. Moving from low to high thresholds, connected components was run on the logical OR of the accumulated binary mask and the remaining binarized pixels above the current threshold level. These components were then dilated toward filling in the surrounding region of voxels with the matching winner-take-all identity using a topological warping technique that does not allow components to become split or merged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kong and Rosenfeld 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legland et al., 2011</xref>). Any remaining ICS or ECS winner-take-all voxels were merged to the nearest (Euclidean distance) ICS or ECS component, respectively. For display of 2D segmentations, we used four colors to label the different components so that no neighboring components were the same color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appel and Haken 1977</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Automated segmentation: 2D metrics</title><p>Pixel categorization error was calculated as the fraction of correctly labeled pixel identities from the CNNs (winner-take-all max probability out of ICS, ECS, MEM) compared to GT test images. To compare components of automated segmentations and GT segmentations, we used the Adapted Rand Error (ARE) and warping error to compare ICS components only.</p><p>The ARE was calculated as 1 minus the F-score of the precision and recall of the Rand Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hubert and Arabie 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2010</xref>). In order to account for significantly different GT component sizes (pixels per component), which can bias the ARE when comparing different ECS datasets, we applied a Bernoulli sampling procedure that sampled (without replacement) GT ICS components and pixels within those components. We used the minimum number of components (n = 71) across the 36 possible sub-images (four ECS fractions x nine sub-images) as the expected number of components selected on each sampling iteration. A portion of pixels within each of the sampled components was then selected. We used the minimum number of pixels per component (n = 20) as the expected number of pixels selected from each component. The ARE was then calculated using only the selected pixels for a particular sampling iteration. We used the median ARE of 1000 samples as the final metric for this procedure.</p><p>We also compared 2D segmentations using the warping error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2010</xref>). Difference pixels were classified by the type of topologic error that they represented, and only split and merger pixels were counted. Connected split and merger pixels (i.e., belonging to the same components being split or merged) were counted as a single split or merger by running connected components (eight connectivity) on pixel errors. We divided the number of splits and mergers by the number of GT components in each test image to fairly compare between datasets (yielding splits per GT component and mergers per GT component).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Automated segmentation: 3D metrics</title><p>For 3D segmentations, we compared automated segmentations with the dense skeletonization for each data volume. Using the skeletons as GT, we calculated: (1) a skeleton node-based ARE; (2) the fraction of split edges and merged nodes and (3) the total error-free path length (TEFPL).</p><p>Overlap between skeletons and segmented 3D supervoxels was calculated as a confusion matrix, where rows correspond to skeletons and columns to supervoxels. Each entry in the matrix is the number of nodes on a given skeleton that are contained within a particular supervoxel. The sum total of all entries is therefore equal to the total number of skeleton nodes (n=5130 LowECS, n=5364 HighECS). The ARE was then calculated based on this confusion matrix using the same calculation as that used for pixel-wise 2D segmentation. Bernoulli sampling was not required in this case as the number of nodes per skeleton was not statistically different between the datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Any nodes that overlapped with membrane areas of the segmentations were represented in the confusion matrix as belonging to a single membrane supervoxel. Both ICS and ECS supervoxels were used in creating the confusion matrix. Overall, only a very few number of skeleton nodes fell into either membrane (n=8, LowECS; n=12, HighECS) or ECS supervoxel locations (n=0, LowECS; n=1, HighECS).</p><p>We also used the supervoxel/skeleton confusion matrix to calculate the fraction of merged nodes. Summing along the rows of the logical confusion matrix (true at locations with at least one node) creates a marginal that indicates which supervoxels overlap with more than one skeleton. All nodes that are within these supervoxels were then counted as merged nodes. The number of merged nodes can then range from zero to the total number of nodes (if all nodes were part of a single supervoxel), which we divided by to get the fraction of merged nodes. To calculate the fraction of split edges, we iterated over the edges of skeletons. An edge was split if both nodes belonging to the edge were located in different supervoxels. If either node was located in a membrane area, the edge was also considered as being split. The number of split edges can then range from zero to the total number of edges (if all supervoxels only contained a single node), which we divided by to get fraction of split edges. To calculate TEFPL, an edge was error free if it was not split and if neither of its nodes was a merged node. We summed the path lengths of all error free edges to get TEFPL, which was expressed as a percentage of the total path length in each volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) or Matlab (The Mathworks). For comparison between two groups of equal size, the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to assess whether there was any significance between medians, then the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for pairwise comparisons in the cases where the Kruskal–Wallis test was significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). For comparison between two groups of equal size, unpaired t-tests were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). For correlation coefficients, the Student's t-test was used with n-2 degrees of freedom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Confidence intervals for 3D skeleton-based error metrics were calculated using a Bernoulli sampling with an expected value of 95% of the minimum number of skeletons (n = 206).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Intramural Research Program.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Pallotto et al. addresses a significant problem in the field of serial electron microscopy applied to connectomics: the inability of current segmentation algorithms to accurately and quickly trace the finest neuronal wires and their connections. The approach of this paper is very interesting and relatively novel since the investigators are focused on improving sample preparation for segmentation algorithms rather than what the majority of the field is focused on, building better algorithms. The issue is related to the shrinkage of the extracellular space associated with the normal aldehyde fixation and processing procedures used for EM. As has long been known (from Van Harreveld's work in the 1950's and 1960's), the ECM is compressed during fixation and subsequent processing, as compartments like dendrites and astroglia swell a little at the expense of the ECM, which is compressed. Strategies to avoid this involve difficult to implement methods such as high pressure freezing and freeze substitution, (the methods introduced by Van Harreveld). This extreme method of stopping action by vitrification is not easy to use or apply to brains without also being concerned with the effects of anoxia on the way to the snap-freezing step. Anoxia itself results in similar differential changes in compartment sizes, at the expense of the ECM space. High osmolality and pressure in perfusions have been tried but results are very inconsistent. This work chose to investigate the utility of a work around using stabilized slice preparations, thus avoiding the concerns above, but introducing the obvious issue of the preparation having been ripped from the brain and then stabilized to be as good as a slice is in faithfully representing the in vivo physiology and anatomy. Since it is well known that significant synaptic remodeling occurs during slice stabilization (at least for the hippocampus where it has been studied carefully) the results here must be considered in the context of the preparation having already endured some likelihood of synaptic and other morphological changes. Nevertheless, the work shows a practical method for swelling extracellular space to make automated tracing more feasible for connectomics work. However, care should be taken to make sure the community does not conclude that this makes the spaces &quot;as they were&quot; in nature. There are a number of other serious concerns that need to be addressed in the revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have not convincingly demonstrated that preservation of the extracellular space will actually substantially improve the automatic segmentation process. The authors only examined 2D segmentation and even within the 2D segmentation results, it is not clear that a certain fraction of ECS maximizes segmentation accuracy with the various metrics used to evaluate segmentation accuracy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref>). Even more problematic is the lack of 3D automatic segmentation results. This is worrisome since there seem to be an abundance of very small neuronal processes (due to the inevitable 'shrinking' of cells caused by ECS preservation relative to standard EM datasets.) This has been well known in the efforts of the current connectomics community for preservation of the ECS and has remained a source of errors for tracing cellular processes in EM datasets. Examples of small processes can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and it is not clear whether they can be accurately traced over 3D either manually or by automatic segmentation. Without 3D segmentation results of these small processes, it remains possible that ECS preservation improves 2D segmentation but could actually worsen 3D segmentation and not improve our ability to trace the finest neuronal processes. Thus 3D segmentation results are important for demonstrating that this study has made a significant advance.</p><p>2) Although the authors clearly demonstrate that ECS preservation can improve human annotation of putative electrical contacts, it is not clear from the study the false positive and negative rates for this detection. We agree with the authors that putative electrical synapses seem to occur in their dataset between cells known to have these connections, but it is difficult to evaluate whether it is possible to get an accurate number of these connections. Given that a 'goal' of dense circuit reconstruction is to move past qualitative descriptions of the type of connectivity between neurons (i.e. they are electrically or synaptically coupled) to quantitating numbers of connections, data about false positive and negative rates would make this result more compelling.</p><p>3) The argument that this approach is going to be valuable for connectomics should rely on the assumption (or better a demonstration) that connections are not altered during acute slice preparation. While it may be true that large-scale connectivity could not change in a few minutes during slice prep, however it is a shame that the authors do not reference the work of Kristin Harris' group showing that spines are lost on neurons in slices during cold shock (Kirov et al., Neuroscience 2004). There was also a follow-up paper showing that this can be largely avoided by preparing slices at room temp (Bourne et al., Neuropharmacology 2007). In the current manuscript, the authors are slicing before fixation at ice-temp. They do not state so clearly in the Materials and methods, but one has to assume from the Materials and methods description here that the slices then went directly into ice-cold fixative. So there is no warm recovery period and one would expect that there would be a severe loss of spines and other changes in microtubules, known to be cold sensitive. True, the synapses are probably still there, but they would appear to be onto dendrites instead of spines. This could make it difficult to distinguish excitatory and inhibitory synapses, for one thing. It means that this approach would not be well suited for use in any study focused on neuronal morphology, rather than just finding connections (with the concern about artifacts of slice preps as above).

Did authors harvest the retina pieces in the same location? Sample size is critical for the antibody penetration because flat mounted retina has different thickness in the central, middle and peripheral portion.

The authors only examined 2D segmentation and even within the 2D segmentation results, it is not clear that a certain fraction of ECS maximizes segmentation accuracy with the various metrics used to evaluate segmentation accuracy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref>). Even more problematic is the lack of 3D automatic segmentation results. This is worrisome since there seem to be an abundance of very small neuronal processes (due to the inevitable 'shrinking' of cells caused by ECS preservation relative to standard EM datasets.) This has been well known in the efforts of the current connectomics community for preservation of the ECS and has remained a source of errors for tracing cellular processes in EM datasets. Examples of small processes can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and it is not clear whether they can be accurately traced over 3D either manually or by automatic segmentation. Without 3D segmentation results of these small processes, it remains possible that ECS preservation improves 2D segmentation but could actually worsen 3D segmentation and not improve our ability to trace the finest neuronal processes. Thus 3D segmentation results are important for demonstrating that this study has made a significant advance.</italic> </p><p>Regarding 2D segmentation results, only <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and 2D</xref> report segmentation performance based on the Rand and Warping error metrics. These two metrics show a statistically significant improvement in segmentation performance for all ECS volume fractions compared to the perfused tissue. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the pixel classification error that is not a metric for segmentation performance. This error metric is sensitive to minor differences in how, for example, pixels are labeled near membranes. For example, if a neural network consistently provides a slightly eroded segmentation relative to ground truth labels, the pixel classification error will be high even though this may not change the resulting segmentation. These issues are discussed in: V. Jain, H. S. Seung, and S. C. Turaga. Machines that learn to segment images: a crucial technology for connectomics.Curr Opin Neurobiol. 20, 653-66 (2010). This reference is cited in the paper (subsection “Reduction in 2D automated segmentation error rates”).</p><p>We have added 3D data and an analysis of 3D segmentation performance to the revised manuscript. These results are presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and discussed in the text under the heading ‘Reduction in 3D automated segmentation error rates’. We collected 10 x 10 x 12 µm<sup>3</sup> cubes of data from the samples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top row (LowECS) and bottom row (HighECS). We trained identical network architectures on sub-volumes from the two 3D datasets. We then densely skeletonized all neurites in the two datasets. Importantly the basic statistics of the skeletons derived from both datasets, including total path length and path length per neurite, were very similar. This serves as another indication that the underlying topology of neurite continuity is not altered by the ECS preservation protocol.</p><p>We then compared the segmentations obtained by varying the threshold on the network output against the skeletons and measured the Rand error, the fraction of merged nodes versus split edges, and total error free skeleton path length. We again observed an improvement in all three of these metrics for the ECS preserved data compared to perfused data, consistent with the 2D results.</p><p><italic>2) Although the authors clearly demonstrate that ECS preservation can improve human annotation of putative electrical contacts, it is not clear from the study the false positive and negative rates for this detection. We agree with the authors that putative electrical synapses seem to occur in their dataset between cells known to have these connections, but it is difficult to evaluate whether it is possible to get an accurate number of these connections. Given that a 'goal' of dense circuit reconstruction is to move past qualitative descriptions of the type of connectivity between neurons (i.e. they are electrically or synaptically coupled) to quantitating numbers of connections, data about false positive and negative rates would make this result more compelling.</italic> </p><p>We agree that deriving false negative rates for detection remains difficult. We refer the reviewers to the estimate from Rash, J. E., T. Yasumura, et al. (1998). &quot;Ultrastructure, histological distribution, and freeze-fracture immunocytochemistry of gap junctions in rat brain and spinal cord.” These authors estimate that the false negative rate for detecting electrical synapses even in high-resolution TEM sections is 75-95% (subsection “Identification of gap junctions in ECS preserved tissue”), an astonishingly high number . Block-face SEM data is typically of a lower lateral resolution than TEM sections (but substantially better Z resolution), 10 x 10 x 25 nm<sup>3</sup> voxels are state-of-the-art, which may lead to an even worse false negative rate. Our view is that the preservation of ECS at least makes it more likely to identify tight contacts that are oriented at arbitrary angles in 3D. That is, ECS preservation shifts detecting electrical synapses from ‘nearly undetectable’ to ‘detectable’ in SBEM data. We view this as a significant advance. Because we do not have a ground truth estimate of the number of gap junctions between AII-AII cells or between AII-CBC cells, we cannot estimate how many we may have missed. We could explicitly label for gap junctions, but that would require the collection of another large dataset and we feel this is beyond the scope of the paper.</p><p>On the other hand, an estimate of false positive rates can be derived from the data presented. Any tight contact that was formed with a cell known to not electrically coupled to AII amacrine cells is a false positive. In our sample, 0 of 21 tight contacts were formed with cells that do not couple to the AII. Therefore, given our sample, our current false positive rate is 0. We note two important details. First, the judgement of whether a contact was tight or cleft was made blind to the identity of the postsynaptic process. It is therefore not possible that we unintentionally biased our results towards cells known to couple to the AII. Second, the distribution of tight contacts along the axis of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) is in agreement with previously described positions of gap junctions. AII-CBC gap junctions are observed at the most distal tips of AIIs and AII-AII gap junctions are observed more proximal to the soma. Our results also show this pattern, further supporting the finding that we did not annotate false positives in our sample.</p><p><italic>3) The argument that this approach is going to be valuable for connectomics should rely on the assumption (or better a demonstration) that connections are not altered during acute slice preparation.

All tissues were fixed at room temperature in the original manuscript. We have added this information to the Materials and methods section. We have also added example images of tissues that were dissected, vibratome sectioned and fixed at room temperature according to the work from Dr. Harris' group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). The results show that ECS volume is preserved equivalently to those sections that were cut in cold buffer. We have added a sentence noting this to the main text (“Preservation of ECS was similar whether tissue was sectioned at 4 °C or 20 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating the described protocol is suitable if alterations of neuronal morphology due to cold shock are a concern (Kirov, Petrak et al. 2004; Bourne, Kirov et al. 2007)”).</p><p>We were very explicit in the manuscript that the preservation of in vivo-like morphologies was not the goal of our study. We feel that the results of a recent study in <italic>eLife</italic> by Korogod, Peterson and Knott clearly demonstrate the value of freezing tissue if the goal is to measure in vivo-like neuronal morphologies. We have added this reference to the manuscript (Discussion).</p><p><italic>4) In the improved diffusion depths of antibodies experiment, authors should provide the negative control data in both fixation conditions.

We have added this detail to the Materials and methods section (subsection “Tissue fixation protocols”). The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref> are, in fact, cross-sections that were cut prior to imaging. That is, flat mounted retinas were immuno-labeled, embedded in agarose and then cross-sectioned before imaging. The cross-section face is what is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>. This information was already in the Materials and methods section. We updated the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> legend to indicate that these are cross sectional images that directly show penetration depth following a flat mount labeling.</p><p>Regarding negative control data for the antibody experiments, we are using commercially available antibodies that have been described previously in the retina literature. Importantly, the labeling patterns we observed are consistent with the known labeling patterns in the retina. Specifically, vACHT labels the two cholinergic bands in the IPL of the retina and vGAT labels throughout the depth of the IPL. We have noted this in the revision and added references that indicate these are the expected labeling patterns (subsection “Improved diffusion depths of antibodies”). Given that we reproduced the known labeling patterns that numerous other retinal neurobiologists have observed, we do not see the value in repeating negative control experiments.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
