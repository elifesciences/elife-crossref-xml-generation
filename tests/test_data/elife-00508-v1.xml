differentiation and discovering new tools that may facilitate clinical applications. Mechanisms that direct neural differentiation of PSCs involve growth factor signaling and transcription regulation. However, it is unknown whether and how electrical activity influences this process. Here we report a high throughput imaging-based screen, which uncovers that selamectin, an anti-helminthic therapeutic compound with reported activity on invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channels, promotes neural differentiation of PSCs. We show that selamectin’s pro-neurogenic activity is mediated by γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in subsets of neural rosette progenitors, accompanied by increased proneural and lineage-specific transcription factor expression and cell cycle exit. In vivo, selamectin promotes neurogenesis in developing zebrafish. Our results establish a chemical screening platform that reveals activity-dependent neural differentiation from PSCs. Compounds identified in this and future screening might prove therapeutically beneficial for treating neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00508.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00508.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00508.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Pluripotent stem cells have the potential to become most of the cell types that make up an organism. However, the signals that trigger these cells to turn into neurons rather than lung cells or muscle cells, for example, are not fully understood. Proteins called growth factors are known to have a role in this process, as are transcription factors, but it is not clear if other factors are also involved.</p><p>In an attempt to identify additional mechanisms that could contribute to the formation of neurons, Sun et al. screened more than 2,000 small molecules for their ability to transform mouse pluripotent stem cells into neurons in cell culture. Surprisingly, they found that a compound called selamectin, which is used to treat parasitic flatworm infections, also triggered stem cells to turn into neurons.</p><p>Selamectin works by blocking a particular type of ion channel in flatworms, but this ion channel is not found in vertebrates, which means that selamectin must be promoting the formation of neurons in mice via a different mechanism. Given that a drug related to selamectin is known to act on a subtype of receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA, Sun et al. wondered whether these receptors—known as GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors—might also underlie the effects of selamectin. Consistent with this idea, drugs that increased GABA<sub>A</sub> activity stimulated the formation of neurons, whereas drugs that reduced GABA<sub>A</sub> function blocked the effects of selamectin.</p><p>In addition, Sun et al. showed that selamectin triggers human embryonic stem cells to become neurons, and that it also promotes the formation of new neurons in developing zebrafish in vivo. As well as revealing an additional mechanism for the formation of neurons from stem cells, the screening technique introduced by Sun et al. could help to identify further pro-neuronal molecules, which could aid the treatment of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), capable of generating most cell types that constitute the entire organism, have made important contributions to our understanding of mammalian biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith, 2001</xref>). How mESCs differentiate into neural lineages is a fascinating question that remains incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okano and Temple, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaspard and Vanderhaeghen, 2010</xref>). Neural induction, the first step in neural differentiation of mESCs, requires active FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ying et al., 2003</xref>) and inhibition of the BMP/TGF-beta pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>). Subsequent regional identity and lineage-guided differentiation are further regulated by the presence or absence of various morphogens or transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinat et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is unknown whether mechanisms additional to growth factors and transcription regulators direct the differentiation of mESCs into neural lineages.</p><p>Effective means for perturbing a complex biological system are key to gaining new insights into the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Small organic molecules have proven to be invaluable tools for probing biological mechanisms, owing to their versatile nature and ease of application and removal from the system under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stockwell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zon and Peterson, 2005</xref>). These features also make bioactive small molecules highly attractive for therapeutic applications. One critical challenge in small molecule discovery is that the chemical space is infinite, thereby requiring high throughput screening for speed and bioassays that are of sufficient specificity and sensitivity to distinguish active small molecules from background noise.</p><p>Here we report an imaging-based screen of ∼2000 bioactive compounds in mESC monolayer cultures labeled with the anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody (a marker for dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adrenergic neurons). We identified small molecules that increased the appearance of TH<sup>+</sup> neurons in the assay, including those with known neurotrophic activity and those that are functionally novel. Notably, we show that the anti-parasitic compound selamectin, with reported activity on invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channels, increased not only TH<sup>+</sup> neurons, but also multiple other neural types including the serotonergic (5-HT), GABAergic, and Islet+ motor neurons as well as Olig2+ oligodendrocytes. We further reveal, through pharmacology, genetics, single-cell electrophysiological recordings and clonal analyses, that selamectin acts by enhancing GABAA receptor signaling, increasing the expression of proneural and lineage-specific transcription factors, and promoting cell cycle exit and differentiation of neural progenitors. We also demonstrate that selamectin can increase neuronal differentiation in human ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as well as in vivo in the developing zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High throughput chemical screen</title><p>In order to apply chemistry to probe the basic biology of neural differentiation from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), we designed a high content screen to isolate small molecules that can increase the total number of TH<sup>+</sup> neurons derived from mESC monolayer cultures. The system was chosen for several reasons: First, the mESC culture system is an established model for understanding neural development, with much insight gained in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okano and Temple, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaspard and Vanderhaeghen, 2010</xref>). Second, mESCs can be cultured in large quantities and in multi-well plates in a high throughput manner. Finally, our adaptation of the mESC monolayer culture and differentiation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ying and Smith, 2003</xref>) showed that a relatively low and consistent number of TH<sup>+</sup> neurons were detected in the culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00508.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High-throughput screening.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the three-stage mESC neuronal differentiation-based chemical screening.

The mESCs of both E14 and 46C lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ying and Smith, 2003</xref>) were used, the latter of which expresses GFP reporter under the control of <italic>sox1</italic> promoter. During stage one, undifferentiated mESCs were cultured on a gelatin-coated surface and in the media without LIF, resulting in neural progenitors that express Sox2, Lmx1a, Nestin, and Sox1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At stage two, neural progenitors were plated into multi-well plates and treated with chemicals for three days. Finally, chemical treatment was withdrawn and cells were cultured for additional three days before immunostaining with anti-TH antibody (Stage three).</p><p>This protocol was further subjected to automation at multiple steps, including cell dispensing into 96-well plate using Thermo Matrix Well Plate, compound distribution into wells using Biomek FXP Laboratory Automation Workstation, immunostaining using Thermo Matrix PlateMate Plus, image capture using GE INCell 1000/2000, and image quantification using INCell Developer software (‘Materials and methods’ for details). We then screened a library containing 2080 biologically active and structurally diverse compounds, including many FDA approved and currently marketed drugs. Compounds were screened at a final concentration of 1 μM in a volume of 120 μl per well containing 0.67% DMSO (vol/vol). After automated immunostaining, image acquisition, and image analysis, the percentage of TH<sup>+</sup> cells in each well was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We did not use actual cell count (as cells in the well are not well separated, making ‘cell count’ inaccurate); instead, we calculated the area of each segmented target. The percentage of TH signal in each well was expressed as a ratio of TH-covered area over DNA-covered area. The final readout was calculated as fold change compared to the DMSO-treated control.

Similar to neural rosette cells, no non-rosette cells displayed only selamectin-induced currents.

Three significant advancements are reported here: First, we have established an imaging-based high content small molecule screening method for identifying chemicals that increase the production of TH<sup>+</sup> DA neurons from mESCs. We have further shown that compounds identified through mESC-based screening are applicable to hPSCs. Second, It has been previously reported that mild electrical stimulation influences mESCs to assume a neuronal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamada et al., 2007</xref>). Through the identification of selamectin, we reveal a novel mechanism underlying the activity-dependent regulation of neuronal differentiation from PSCs. Third, by employing single-cell electrophysiological recordings of mESC-derived neural rosette cells, we uncover for the first time the heterogeneity of neural progenitor responses to GABA and selamectin, which has provided a plausible explanation for paradoxical observations of GABA’s effects on in vivo neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tozuka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Song et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Compared to previous high content chemical screening for neuronal enhancers in embryonic stem/progenitor cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saxe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desbordes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>), the advances of our method are the following: First, Instead of using culture systems that require either feeder cells or neurosphere formation, our assay uses the monolayer differentiation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ying and Smith, 2003</xref>), thus is simple and easy to carry out. Second, the use of monolayer differentiation also renders the background noise fairly low, with baseline TH<sup>+</sup> cells of 0.5–3% in control (DMSO) conditions. Third, compared to previous screening that uses either pluripotency markers (e.g., Oct4) or general neuronal differentiation markers (e.g., a-tubulin or TuJ1), we used the neuronal subtype specific marker TH. The small number of TH<sup>+</sup> cells makes the quantification convenient and accurate, thereby significantly increasing the sensitivity of our assay. Finally, our assay is the first that offers the prospect for identifying compounds that regulate neuronal subtype differentiation, since previous assays use only general pluripotency or neuronal markers.</p><p>This screening platform has enabled us to identify selamectin and show that it increases the production of multiple neuronal lineage types including DA, 5-HT, GABA, and Islet<sup>+</sup> neurons as well as olig2<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes. Selamectin is known to target invertebrate glutamate-guided chloride channels that have no orthologues in vertebrates. Our pharmacological, genetic and clonal studies provide first evidence that selamectin targets the γ2 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor to promote progenitor cell cycle exit toward terminal differentiation. Single-cell electrophysiological recordings further show that a subset of neural rosette cells responds to GABA and selamectin via functional GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The blocking of GABA-induced current by bicuculline (the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist), however, is incomplete, suggesting that GABA receptors other than GABA<sub>A</sub> are also expressed in neural rosette progenitors. Expression of functional GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors has been demonstrated in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwirtlich et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, many recorded neural rosette cells display very low membrane input resistance (less than 100 MΩ), and high membrane capacitances (up to 50 pF). Furthermore, applications of 100 μM meclofenamic acid (MFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2005</xref>) could reversibly reduce the inward currents when the membrane potential of the cells are held at −70 mV. These observations suggest that neural rosette cells may be electrically connected, similar to neural progenitor cells in the ventricular zone of embryonic brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LoTurco et al., 1995</xref>) and those in the sub-ventricular zone of adult brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, it is possible that functional GABA receptors expressed in one cell may render other electrically connected cells to display apparent GABA-induced currents.</p><p>Our data reveal that selamectin increases the expression of proneural and lineage-specific transcription factors while reducing proliferation in mESC cultures. Clonal analysis and time-lapse live imaging further uncover the role of selamectin (hence, likely GABA) in promoting progenitor cell cycle exit toward terminal differentiation. These molecular and cellular findings, together with the pharmacogenetic and electrophysiological studies, lead us to propose that selamectin-potentiated activation of the γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in mESC-derived neural progenitor cells causes Cl<sup>−</sup> outflow (due to the high internal chloride levels in these progenitor cells), thereby leading to the depolarization of neural progenitors and calcium influx. This further activates proneural and lineage-specific transcription factors, which have established roles in promoting cell cycle exit toward terminal neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Such neural activity-dependent regulation of transcription factor expression has been reported in developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demarque and Spitzer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marek et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings suggest that this is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon.</p><p>GABA signaling influences embryonic cortical neural progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owens and Kriegstein, 2002</xref>) and regulates adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ge et al., 2007</xref>). Paradoxically, either an increase or a decrease of neurogenesis by GABA activation has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tozuka et al., 2005</xref>).

Our single neural rosette cell recordings, which reveal the heterogeneous responses among progenitors, provide an explanation as to why the influence of GABA signaling on neurogenesis appears cell type- and context-dependent.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that our screen of 2000 compounds was not successful in identifying chemicals that specifically increase DA neuronal production, suggesting that these compounds may be rare, and large compound libraries need to be screened in order to find them. The high throughput capability of our assay will enable such screen to be carried out, and is thus an important future direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and high throughput chemical screen</title><p>The mouse ESC lines E14Tg2a and 46C were used. 46C was a generous gift from Dr Austin Smith, in which GFP was knocked into the <italic>sox1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ying and Smith, 2003</xref>). mESCs were cultured in GMEM media (G5154, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (characterized, Hyclone, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), beta-mercaptoethanol, and 500–1000 units per ml of leukocyte inhibitory factor (ESG1107, Chemicon, Billerica, MA), on gelatinized cell culture surface without feeder cells.</p><p>To induce neuronal differentiation, the monolayer differentiation protocol developed by Ying et al.

We used cell line that expresses GFP under SOX1 promoter. For majority of neural rosettes, we also verified their GFP signals. There are also non-rosette GFP positive cells, among which are new born neurons. New born neurons were identified based on their characteristic morphology, round-shaped cell body. The whole-cell recordings were performed at room temperature. Pipette electrodes (Sutter, Novato, CA) were fabricated using a Sutter P-97 horizontal puller and fire-polished and had final tip resistances of 2–4 MΩ. All recording have been performed using gap free protocol while the membrane potential was holding at −70 mV. The bath solution contained (in mM) NaCl 110, KCl 30, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, HEPES 5, and glucose 10, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The internal solution for patch recordings contained (in mM) NaCl 10, KCl 130, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, HEPES 5, EGTA 1,and MgATP 5, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. The applications of the activation and inhibition reagents were performed by a pressurized micro-perfusion system. The pressure was typically 7–10 kPa. The stock solutions were made by dissolving the reagents in the bath solution (GABA) or DMSO (bicuculline and selamectin). The stock solutions were kept at −80°C and were diluted to the working concentration using bath solution before each experiment. Unless otherwise indicated, we used 100 μM GABA, 100 μM bicuculline and 8 μM selamectin. The working solutions of bicuculline and selamectin contained up to 0.5% DMSO, therefore the bath solutions containing the corresponding concentration of DMSO were routinely used as control solution prior to the applications of bicuculline or selamectin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Differentiation of multiple neuronal lineages from human pluripotent stem cells</title><p>The human ESC lines H9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomson et al., 1998</xref>) and a human iPSC line (a gift from Dr Bruce Conklin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kreitzer et al., 2013</xref>) were used.

(subject to the approval of the authors). An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) As already discussed by the authors themselves, the effects of selamectin should be tested for the neuronal differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells.</p><p>2) It is likely that selamectin induced mESC differentiation into multiple neural lineages. However, it is not clear whether this effect is due to the heterogeneity of neural progenitor cells derived from mESCs. In the former case, selamectin could have just induced the terminal differentiation of precursor cells already committed toward particular neuronal lineages. Alternatively, selamectin must have induced the mESC differentiation into multiple neural lineages by different mechanisms. This issue should be investigated by clonal analysis of mESC-derived neuronal progenitor cells to examine the effects of selamectin.</p><p>3) One of the primary conclusions of the paper is that selamectin is functioning as a GABAA agonist. The most compelling evidence for this was pharmacological: the structurally unrelated GABA agonist muscimol had a similar effect, while GABA antagonists reduced the effect of selamectin. It would likely strengthen the case if there were some non-pharmacological (e.g., genetic) evidence.</p><p>4) In the present assay, authors used TH as a readout marker to address neuronal subtype (dopaminergic neuron)-directed differentiation, but their hit compounds increased the differentiation of multiple neuronal lineages without selectivity for specific neuronal subsets. In this point, their screening was not successful in getting subtype-selective compounds. Authors should make comments for this criticism and should discuss in the text.</p><p>5) Because the present assay focuses on ratio of TH positivity instead of cell number, compounds that reduce viability of a non-neuronal cell type could also appear to be increasing neural differentiation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00508.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) As already discussed by the authors themselves, the effects of selamectin should be tested for the neuronal differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the experiment using both the human embryonic stem cells (H9) and the human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC).

The results as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> indicate that selamectin did not change cell cycle length or the clone size. Rather, it increased differentiated neurons at the expense of proliferative progenitors. This, together with our previous observation that selamectin decreases proliferation and increases the expression of proneural and lineage-associated transcription factors, suggests that it promotes progenitor cell cycle exit toward terminal differentiation.</p><p><italic>3) One of the primary conclusions of the paper is that selamectin is functioning as a GABAA agonist.

However, reduced viability of non-neuronal cell types would be detectable as it would lead to a significant reduction of total cell numbers in the well compared to controls. Furthermore, clonal analysis, as we have shown in the revised manuscript, will be able to further discern this possibility.</p></body></sub-article></article>
